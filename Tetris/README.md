# TetrisGame
A command-line interface Tetris game. First OOP project.

This is the final project of the course "Object Oriented Programing C++".
We were required to program a Tetris game in C ++.
This is the first project in OOP that we have developed within the framework of the degree.

We designed the classes architecture as generously as possible.
In addition, we programed the "shape" class in such a way that we can add new differnt shapes in a simple way by adding a minimum code.
